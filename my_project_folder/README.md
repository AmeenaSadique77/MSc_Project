# MSc_Project
This project aims to enhance personalized medicine by integrating pharmacogenomic data into clinical decision-making to improve drug efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Using the Translational Pharmacogenetics Project (TPP) dataset, the study will identify key genetic markers and develop predictive models for drug response. 


Despite pharmacogenomics' potential, its clinical implementation is limited by challenges in data integration, interpretation, and application. This research addresses these issues through three main objectives: identifying relevant genetic variations, analyzing drug response data, and developing predictive models using machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning models. 


The project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model development, and validation, all while considering ethical and legal implications. The goal is to create validated predictive models that can influence future clinical guidelines and policies, leading to improved drug efficacy, reduced adverse reactions, and enhanced patient care. The findings aim to impact both academic research and clinical practice, promoting the adoption of pharmacogenomic-guided treatments and advancing precision medicine.
