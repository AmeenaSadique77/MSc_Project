# MSc_Project
This project aims to advance personalized medicine by integrating pharmacogenomic data into clinical decision-making to enhance drug efficacy and minimize adverse effects. The study leverages the Translational Pharmacogenetics Project (TPP) dataset to identify key genetic markers and develop predictive models for drug response. Despite the potential of pharmacogenomics to improve patient outcomes, its implementation in clinical practice remains limited due to challenges in data integration, interpretation, and application.
The research addresses this gap by focusing on three main objectives: identifying relevant genetic variations, analyzing drug response data, and developing predictive models. The project employs machine learning techniques, including random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning models, to predict individual drug responses based on genetic profiles.
Key steps include data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model development, and validation. The study considers ethical and legal implications, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and addressing issues of patient privacy and informed consent.
By developing validated predictive models for drug response, this project aims to influence future clinical guidelines and policies. The expected outcomes include improved drug efficacy, reduced adverse reactions, and enhanced overall patient care. This research contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and lays the groundwork for future studies in pharmacogenomics as more genetic and clinical data become available.
The project's findings are expected to be of interest to both academic researchers and healthcare practitioners, potentially impacting clinical practice and paving the way for more widespread adoption of pharmacogenomic-guided treatment decisions.
